# 🚀 60 Days DSA Challenge

This repository is dedicated to solving **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems from beginner to advanced level in **60 days**.  
Each day contains **5 questions** inside its respective folder (`Day1`, `Day2`, ... `Day60`).

### 📂 Repository Structure

<pre>
60Days-DSA-Challenge/
│── Day1/
│ └── README.md
│── Day2/
│ └── README.md
│── ...
|── README.md
</pre>

### 📝 Daily Format

Each `DayX/README.md` contains:

- **Problem Description**
- **Sample Input/Output (bash style)**
- **Step-by-step progression from basic → advanced**

---

## 🛠️ How to Attempt Questions

1. Go to the respective **DayX** folder (e.g., `Day1/`).
2. Inside it, create a folder for the language you want to solve in:
   - `Java/`
   - `CPP/`
   - `Python/`
   - etc.
3. Inside that folder, create files for each question with the following naming convention:
   - `Que1.java`
   - `Que2.cpp`
   - `Que3.py`
   - etc.

✅ Example structure for **Day 1**:

```
Day1/
│── Questions.md
│── Java/
│ ├── Que1.java
│ ├── Que2.java
│── CPP/
│ ├── Que1.cpp
│ ├── Que2.cpp
│── Python/
│ ├── Que1.py
│ ├── Que2.py

```
